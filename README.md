# Yinsh_AI
An AI that plays the board board game called YINSH from the GIPF series. Additionally there is a board-state analyzer (BSA) that determines which player is in a better position. The BSA uses a variety of heuristics to come to its conclusion. The AI uses the BSA to choose the next best move possible.
